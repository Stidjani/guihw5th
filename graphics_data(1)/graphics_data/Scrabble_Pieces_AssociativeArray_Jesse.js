//find a way to randomly grab these tiles at the correct probability [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
//on page load and reset click, generate 7 random letters, these need to give the divs the point value and the letter [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
//when a piece is dragged onto a board space, you take the letter tag and put that letter in the position of the board space and bring up the points [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
//when a piece is removed from a board space, we remove the letter from that position and reduce the points, if not placed on a new board space, shove it back in the rack[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
//button to refresh all keys, it needs to delete all the divs and make 7 more on the rack
//button to submit word, it needs to take the current points and add them to the max points, and then add x more tiles to the rack
//when total tiles left = 0, add a paragraph that says you win
//button to restart the whole game
